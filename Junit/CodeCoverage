Code Coverage, as the name suggests, is all about measuring how well your tests cover your code. 
In other words, it describes the degree to which the coding of an application has been tested when a particular test suite runs. 
It is considered one of the forms of White Box Testing and is usually performed by Developers during Unit Testing.

>We use three primary terms to describe each line executed.

1)hit indicates that the source code was executed by the test suite.
2)partial indicates that the source code was not fully executed by the test suite; there are remaining branches that were not executed.
3)miss indicates that the source code was not executed by the test suite.

How is Code Coverage measured?
It can be calculated using the formula:

Code Coverage Percentage = (Number of lines of code executed)/(Total Number of lines of code in an application) * 100.

Why is Code Coverage important?
Code Coverage is essential because it:

Helps in maintaining the code base while also letting any features be added later with little-to-no-efforts.
Helps in exposing bad, dead, and unused codes. Thereby maintaining the product quality.
Helps in finishing the software development process faster, thus, helping in increasing productivity and efficiency.
Helps companies to launch more software applications in the market in lesser time.
Helps to increase customer satisfaction
